# credit-risk-classification
 module_20

This assignment involved sample data to help us evaluate creditworthiness of borrowers.  I used the starter code in jupyter notebook to complete this assignment.  We imported the data, split it, and completed a logistic regression to predict healthy and high-risk loans.  We then did the same thing with scaled data.  

The next requirement was to write a report with the provided template.  

This assignment was completed with class examples and internet searches.
